Java has 8 primitive data types; char, boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, and double. For this exercise, we'll work with the primitives used to hold integer values (byte, short, int, and long):

A byte is an 8-bit signed integer.
A short is a 16-bit signed integer.
An int is a 32-bit signed integer.
A long is a 64-bit signed integer.
Given an input integer, you must determine which primitive data types are capable of properly storing that input.

To get you started, a portion of the solution is provided for you in the editor.
