Objective<br>
In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.<br><br>

Task<br>
Given an integer, N, print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple N x i(where 1 =< i =< 10) <br>
should be printed on a new line in the form: N * i = result. <br><br>

Input Format <br>

A single integer, N.<br><br>

Constraints<br>

2 =< N =< 20<br><br>

Output Format<br>

Print 10 lines of output; each line i (where 1 =< i =< 10) contains the result of N * i in the form:<br>
