Gradind Students <br>
HackerLand University has the following grading policy:<br><br>

Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.<br>
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.<br>
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:<br><br>

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.<br>
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.<br>
